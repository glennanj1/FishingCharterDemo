            Capt. Frank will do his best to make sure you have a fun day full of fishing, which involves 5 to 10-hour trips. In the spring, you can target Striped Bass in the Raritan Bay. These trips are action-packed and you’re just about guaranteed to bring home dinner! During the spring and summer months, the captain moves the boat down to Belmar to target Seabass, Fluke, Tuna, Mahi, sharks, Blackfish, and whatever else you would like to fish for. On these trips, you can expect to use techniques such as light tackle, heavy tackle, bottom fishing, trolling, fly fishing, big game fishing, jigging, popping, and spinning.
